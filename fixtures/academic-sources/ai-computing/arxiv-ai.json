      "abstract": "We demonstrate that scale alone can produce unexpected mathematical reasoning capabilities in language models without explicit training. Our analysis of models ranging from 1B to 175B parameters reveals a sharp phase transition in mathematical problem-solving ability that emerges around 70B parameters. Models below this threshold perform at chance level on complex mathematical reasoning tasks, while those above it solve 82% of problems correctly. We identify three distinct reasoning capabilities that emerge sequentially: arithmetic operations, algebraic manipulation, and abstract mathematical reasoning. The emergent abilities generalize across mathematical domains and are robust to variations in problem formatting. Notably, these capabilities appear without any specific mathematical training data, suggesting they arise from the model's internal representations of language structure and logic.",

      "abstract": "We propose a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that adapts large pretrained models to new domains using only 0.1% of trainable parameters. Our approach, called AdaptLayer, introduces lightweight adapter layers that learn domain-specific transformations while preserving the original model's capabilities. Extensive experiments on 12 domains including medical, legal, and scientific texts show that AdaptLayer achieves comparable performance to full fine-tuning while reducing computational costs by three orders of magnitude. The method also enables simultaneous multi-domain adaptation without catastrophic forgetting. We demonstrate that our approach can be combined with other parameter-efficient methods for even greater efficiency gains. Analysis of the learned representations reveals that AdaptLayer captures domain-specific semantic patterns while maintaining general language understanding.",

Our quantum algorithms leverage quantum superposition and entanglement to process high-dimensional feature spaces more efficiently than classical approaches. We implement these algorithms on existing quantum hardware with up to 127 qubits and demonstrate superior performance on three benchmark tasks: high-dimensional optimization, quantum chemistry simulation, and complex pattern recognition. The quantum approach shows particular advantage when dealing with quantum mechanical data, where it achieves up to 100x speedup. We also provide theoretical analysis showing that the quantum advantage holds for certain problem classes under realistic noise conditions. This work represents a significant step toward practical quantum advantage in machine learning.",
